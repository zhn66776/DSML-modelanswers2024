    "<a id=\"x1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have all the elements to do meaningful calculations using ndarrays. We will apply this to a simple example. You are asked to calculate the sedimentation rate in a given well. For this, you are provided with an ndarray with two dimensions (i.e., a matrix). The first vector column represents the depth of a stratigraphic marker [**in meters**] below the seafloor. The second column represents the age of the marker in millions of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two objectives in this exercise:\n",
    "1. To produce a matrix that shows the sedimentation rate between each marker in **cm/kyr**. Note that the units are different than the units you were given above, so you will need to account for that.\n",
    "2. I also want to know what the average sedimentation for this site is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise parameters:\n",
    "1. You cannot use any type of loops\n",
    "2. As a hint, you will need to use indexing and slicing. \n",
    "3. Keep in mind that you can make several different slices from the original dataset. \n",
    "4. In addition, don't lose sight of the fact that a sedimentation rate is calculated *between* two points in a well. So if you have n age points, there will be n-1 sedimentation rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You may want to look up numpy's documentation to see if there is a simple NumPy function that does what you want. This is an important part of problem-solving in Data Science - the ability to efficiently search documentation to see if there are tools that you can use to make your life easier, rather than coding them yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it *is* possible to complete this exercise without using any new functions!"

    "1. In order to merge the dataset, we will use the `Depth (mbsf)` column in both files as the key for the merge, but rounded to the closest full meter. Why the rounding? Otherwise, you will only have 4 samples with the exact same depth. If we round the values first, we will have more overlap between the two datasets. Check the documentation for the Pandas `.round()` method to learn to use it.\n",
    "2. Write a simple function that takes a dataframe as an argument, and outputs a copy of this dataframe but with the `Depth (mbsf)` column rounded to the nearest meter. I have given you below the function's signature, i.e. its name and the main argument (`def round_depth(df)`). Replace the `pass` with the code needed for this function. **Bonus**: Can you do this without making changes to the original DataFrame?\n",
    "3. Write a second function (`merge_by_depth(df1,df2)` below) that takes two dataframes, and returns a new, merged dataframe using the `Depth (mbsf)` column for the merge.\n",
    "4. Finally, apply the two functions above to merge the `geochemistry_df` and  `ngr_df` dataframes, and calculate the mean value of carbonate content for samples with a `Corr. Counts` larger than 30."
